# GBM2K-Framework

## Description

The GBM2K (Grid Based Movement 2K) Framework is a Godot 3 framework made for 2D top-down grid based games like YumeNikki.

The framework replicates the grid movement seen in RPG Maker 2000 while keeping things simple and easily modifiable.
I will not add a dialogue system to this framework because :
  - A - The projects goal is to make a simple 2D Grid Base Movement system that people can build off of. 
  - B - There are many options for Dialogue Systems in Godot, and I'd rather people make that decision for themselves.

## Features

- An input priority system, that prioritizes the last directional key pressed
- Movement animations that alternate between swinging the left and right arm for each grid move
- Modifiable Actor movement speed, that also speeds up the animation accordingly
- Moving NPC's that interact correctly with the grid, and don't act buggy when the player bumps into them

## Other info

Credits to GDQuest and their Grid Based Movement system, without it this wouldn't be possible.
Also credits to Jason Perry for the sprites. These sprites are from the OpenRTP.

If you encounter any bugs with an **unmodified version of the framework**, please post the issue on Github with a video attached.
